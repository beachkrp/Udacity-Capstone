Udacity Capstone Project

#Installation

#Motivation
Capstone Project for Udacity Data Science Nano Degree

#Topic
Using Scala to examine and create a machine learning model to detect user churn for a music streaming service. 

#Limitations

Unable to deploy on an AWS cloud service because in a matter of three days, the maximum allowable s3 requests on the Free Tier had been exhausted for the month of August and the project was due before that date, therefore on the mini-subet was used. 

Due to time constraints, the various Parameter grids were not as extensive as I would have liked to explore.
